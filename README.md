## Explanation of the Feed Forward Neural Network and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) in Flappy Bird scenario

In this project the AI teaches itself how to play Flappy Bird.
The way this works is that it starts completely random, having no idea what to do and how the game even operates.
Only after many generations of slowly learning and getting better, it finally picks up on patterns on what it can do to progress further in the level.

To achieve this, Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks are being used together.
In this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/gas-and-nns-6a41f1e8146d) you can read a great evaluation on using Neural Networks (NNs) with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to accelerate the learning process.

## Source of inspiration

Inspiration for this project was taken from CodeBullet.
